//The location on the OS X filesystem of this drive's contents.
//This is the canonical location of the drive and is used when resolving absolute
//URLs to DOS filesystem paths. It may or may not be the same as the location that
//actually gets mounted in DOSBox: see mountPointURL below.

//Several properties are derived automatically from the source URL: Changing the
//source URL will recalculate mountPointURL, letter, title, volumeLabel and type
//unless these have been explicitly overridden.
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSURL *sourceURL;

//The OS X filesystem location that will be mounted in DOSBox.
//Usually this is the same as the source URL, but differs for e.g. CD-ROM bundles.
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSURL *mountPointURL;

//An optional location on the OS X filesystem to which we will perform
//shadow write operations for this drive. That is, any files that are
//opened for modification on this drive will be silently written to this
//location instead of creating/modifying files in the original location.
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSURL *shadowURL;


//The DOS drive letter under which this drive will be mounted.
//If nil, BXEmulator will choose an appropriate drive letter at mount time
//(and update this property with the chosen letter).
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSString *letter;

//The display title to show for this drive in drive lists. Automatically derived
//from the filename of the source URL, but can be modified.
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSString *title;

//The volume label to use for this drive in DOS. Automatically derived from the filename
//of the source URL, but can be modified. For image-based drives this value is ignored,
//since the volume label is stored inside the image itself.
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSString *volumeLabel;

//The volume label that the drive ended up with after mounting in DOS.
//This is populated by BXEmulator when the drive is first mounted and will be a munged
//version of the above: cropped to 11 characters and uppercased for most drive types.
@property (copy, nonatomic) NSString *DOSVolumeLabel;

//The amount of free disk space to report for the drive, in bytes. Defaults to

//Note that this is not an enforced limit: it only affects how much free space is reported
//to DOS programs.

//If YES, DOS emulation will read CD audio for this drive from the first audio CD volume mounted in OS X.

//Determines the most appropriate drive type for the specified file or folder. This is based on:
//1. the file's type identifier: e.g. disk images will be treated as CD-ROM or floppy drives;
//2. the filesystem of the URL's volume: e.g. folders located on a CD-ROM volume will be detected as CD-ROMs.
+ (BXDriveType) preferredTypeForContentsOfURL: (NSURL *)URL;

//Determines a suitable DOS volume label for the specified location.
//For regular folders and CD-ROM volumes, this will be their filename;

//minus extension and parsed drive letter (see preferredDriveLetterForContentsOfURL: below.)

//Determines a suitable display title for the specified location.
//This is currently the base filename of the path including file extension.

//Determines a recommended drive letter from the specified location,

//If the location is a disk image or a Boxer mountable folder, and the filename starts with a single
//letter followed by a space, this will be parsed out and used as the drive letter.

//Indicates that the specified URL represents the same resource as the contents of this drive.
//This is used by the drive's filesystem to correctly resolve URLs to resources in different apparent locations.
//Mainly this is of use for drives representing disk images: so that if the image is mounted
//as a folder in OS X, the drive will treat locations within the mounted folder as being contained
